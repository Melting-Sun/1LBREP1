Distinctiveness and Complexity

The page is not similar to anything we have already created. It's not a social media app nor an e-commerce. It's not similar to other years projects either.
in terms of complexity i have used several javascript libraries such as material ui , react leaflet,
and for python geodjango and i have used django rest framework and django corse headers i have used
axios library with useEffect hook to make request to the backend and i have used pillow the python library
and i have used the python library djoser and i have multiple python and javascript files
in my application and i have used postgresql

and see the detals and listing of all properties that has been added to the map by all users
