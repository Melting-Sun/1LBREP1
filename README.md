Distinctiveness and Complexity


The page is not similar to anything we have already created. It's not a social media app nor an e-commerce. It's not similar to other years projects either.
in terms of complexity i have used several javascript libraries such as material ui , react leaflet,
and for python geodjango and i have used django rest framework and django corse headers i have used
axios library with useEffect hook to make request to the backend and i have used pillow the python library
and i have used the python library djoser and i have multiple python and javascript files
in my application and i have used postgresql as my database






Main Idea

i have created a location based real estate projrct aka lbrep i have used many technologies
in my project both in the backend and front end side of the project it is mainly used two 
programming languages which are python in the backend and javascript in the fronted
the two main frameworks are django in the backend and react on the frontend side
my project purpose is that so people can see properties based on location and on the map
so its easier for someone who wants a house or property in a specefic location
so i have used libraries such as react leaflet which is a java script library in frontend for that purpose 
so the user can register in the app or login add a property on the map so i have provided a form for that
in the form i get the user info such as property name borough what the property has the pictures and so on
and the user also can serach bouroghs in and out of a city and the user will be provided a list of bouroghs 
and when the user click on a specefic borough the app will fly on that borough and the borough will be painted by a
color for usser to see it better 
and the form contains feature such as when u click on the property status if it is on rent u get
to fill out rental frequency filed if it is on sale u cant fill out that form
it has checkboxes for showing the property options when it is shown on the list
such as parking cctv pool furnished ... and the user can check these options and pervent from
writing those manually in the descriotion field
i have provided a marker on the map which user can easily move it across the map to find the specefic location
he has in mind
the user also can select if he wants to add a property inside the city of choice or outside of it 
and then wil be provided by the boroughs of it 
it has a part for selecting images of the property
the listing page contains the map which the properties are shown on and the listing in the side
on the side a list of the properties provided with the username of the person who has added it 
and a picture of the property the price tag and wether it is for sale or rent
the listing is from the most recent on the top to the oldest on the bottom
and it has a map icon on the top right corner so when the user clicks on the map will fly to 
that property on the map where ever it is 
the properties on the map are shown with a specefic icons and when the user clicks on them
they will be provided with a description the user who has added it and a picture of the property 
and the detail part
there is a big button called LBREP which is like the home button of my app and when you click on 
it it will take you to the homepage of my application 
and another big button in the center of my application which says see all propeties which
is an alternative of listing button for ease of the user
